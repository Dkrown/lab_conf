Setting up git-account to create a repository from CLI
******************************************************

#Assuming you already open a github account
Frist, generate a new ssh key to add your github account
#To generate, use below command:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@whatever.com" (This is the email you used to open your github account)

#Add the new generated to the ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

#Copy and add the ssh key to your github account
nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

- From your github account dashboard:
- Click on your profile icon/name
- From the drop down list, select Settings
- On the new window, under Access, click on SSH and GPG Keys
- Click on New SSH Key
- Paste your copied ssh key into the Key box and give it a 'Title'
- Next click on Add SSH Key!

#Test SSH connection to github from your Linux CLI using this command
ssh -T git@github.com
- If you get the below response back, your ssh connection is ok, otherwise...
- Hi Yourname! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

#Back to github
#From your github account, click the "+" icon in the top right corner of the page
#then select  "New repository" from the dropdown menu and fill out Repository info.
#Do not initialise README or add any .gitignore or license files on as these will
#be created locally from your terminal.
#Now, the fun part, go to your terminal and start running these commands

echo "echo "# yourfile" >> README.md (This create READ.md file needed)
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"(You can change message in double quote, if you want)

#NOTE: After running the last command (git commit -m...) above, you might a message, if you, run the these commands
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com" (email used to open github)
git config --global user.email "your_github_profile_name"

#Now, continue...
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:profile_name/repository_name.git
git push -u origin main

#That's it, you just created your first github repository!
